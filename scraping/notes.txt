Scraped information from members of the Maryland House of Delegates by the following link:
https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/06hse/html/hseal.html

Went to each of their individual pages and pulled their name, party, district, county, a phone number, and their email addresses.
A dataset to quickly sort by party, but also provide contact information to voters.

(did it all in one commit which isnt the best I guess so sorry about that)
